#### 2. Launch Mastodon and import TGMM data set

   Search for mastodon in the box once you have restarted Fiji.

   Browse to the .xml file and TGMM folder as guided. For ITEC results, they can be found under `mastodon` folder. Click import button.

   Then the main window of Mastodon pops up. Click bdv for visualization of the data and results. Click trackscheme for cell fate maps. Click selection table for detailed data of the spots selected.

#### 3. View data through bdv, trackscheme and selection table.

   The bdv and trackscheme windows should be as follows. Use Ctrl+Shift+ScrollWheel to zoom in either window.

   By clicking the lock 1 in top-left corner of the two windows, a link is established between the two. Then you may choose a certain detection in the trackscheme and it will be shown in the bdv, and vice versa.

   In bdv, scroll the wheel to scroll through z slides. Press -/+ to view through frames. Press i to apply interpolation. Press v to change overlay mode, e.g. to only show the track of the target cell.

   Select several spots in bdv or trackscheme, and their position information will be shown in the selection table window.
