## Mastodon usage

   Here is a simplified guide to the installation and usage of Mastodon. Please refer to [Mastodon documentation](https://mastodon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more detailed instructions.
   
#### 1. Start Fiji/ImageJ and get Mastodon.
   Click [here](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads) for Fiji/ImageJ download. Start the `Help`-`Update`.
