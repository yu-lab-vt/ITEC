## Examples

Here, we provide two examples of ITEC cell tracking, including the raw data and parameter tables. Users can directly run [demo_data1.m](demo_data1.m), [demo_data1.m](demo_data1.m), and view the results.

The raw **data1** can be download from https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/cbcb3d00ae5148c992d8/.

The raw **data2** can be download from https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/92c0dd9794db41e5ab6f/.

Additionally, we provide the parameter tables for the four datasets ([FISH1](params_FISH1.csv), [FISH2](params_FISH2.csv), [MOUSE](params_MOUSE.csv), and [DRO](params_DRO.csv)) mentioned in our paper, which are available for users to test and use.
